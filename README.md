## Improving Performances of Speech Recognizers on Numbers
Final Project for COMS E6998-7 (Fall 2019) by Patrick Kwok (lk2754@columbia.edu)

This repository contains the Python code for a "toolbox" useful for speech recognition and speech synthesis purposes. This "toolbox" contains functions for generating all possible methods for saying, or spelling out, numbers within a given sentence, as well as the corresponding probabilities for each of the possible methods.

In the future, given these possible methods and corresponding probabilities, alignments with the audio can be performed, and the most probable spelt-out form for each number given both the sentence and the audio can be determined. Eventually, the Arabic numerals in the training transcript can be replaced with the most likely spelt-out forms, and this will have an effect of improving the performances of speech recognizers on numbers.
